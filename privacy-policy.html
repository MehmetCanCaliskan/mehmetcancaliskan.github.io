                        The right to withdraw consent
                        
                        If we have asked for your consent to our processing of your data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, see Article 7 of the GDPR.

                        The withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.
